**Unit 6: Public Finance Trends and Debates in the United States** <span
id="6"></span> 
*This unit applies the public finance concepts you have learned
throughout the course to the example of the United States Government. 
It begins by familiarizing you with some background information on the
U.S. government's aggregate taxation and expenditure over the last 100
years.  You will learn that both taxes and expenditure have grown
steadily over this period by taking a look at publicly-available
measures of these taxes and expenditures and discussing the types of
taxes and expenditures we should expect to find at different levels of
government.  The unit will go on to review some of the major
contemporary debates in US government spending and taxation, including:
(i) the Bush tax cuts, (ii) the stimulus bill, and (iii)proposed
constitutional limits on spending.*

    comprehensive budgets.  Although each state has its own process,
    these readings will illustrate some of the complexities of the state
    budgeting process.

    additional government spending?  Is there a risk that temporary
    spending will become permanent?
