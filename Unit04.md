**Unit 4: Rent Seeking and Other Government Failures** <span
id="4"></span> 
*In this unit, we will discuss the implications of several Public Choice
models that relate to raising and spending of government revenue.  We
will begin by “rent-seeking.”*  *Rent seeking refers to lobbying the
government for policies that give interest groups above-market profits. 
Subsidies and taxes are potential tools for rent-seeking.  If Company A
can get the government to tax a competitor (Company B) more heavily or
subsidize Company A directly, it can earn “rents” by being able to
operate at a lower internal cost.  We will revisit the question of
government failure as a result of rent-seeking behavior. *  
  
 *Next, we will consider how arguments in favor of rent-seeking are
framed “in the public interest.”  Bruce Yandle's theory of “Bootleggers
and Baptists” tells the tale of how publicly interested persons end up
supporting their opponents.  “X-inefficiencies” are those that arise
from subsidized industries that need greater and greater subsidies to
survive, and thus spend more money to secure those subsidies.  The
term “Iron Triangles” refers to relationships of mutual interest that
form between special interest groups, bureaucrats, and politicians and
effectively block democratic efforts to reduce or remove special
subsidies and taxes.  We will then consider several efforts that have
been made to get around these problems, including The Grace Commission,
the Graham-Rudman Act, and the Base Realignment and Closure Commission.*
