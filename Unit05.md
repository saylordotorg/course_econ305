**Unit 5: Macroeconomic Considerations in Public Finance** <span
id="5"></span> 
*When market forces were unable to swiftly resolve the economic
devastation brought on by the stock market crash in 1929, economists
began to look for explanations of why the economy did not behave as the
traditional models had predicted.  One of the schools of thought that
emerged from these debates was the structural Keynesian school.  This
new school of thought posited that in time of economic crisis, investors
do not respond to a fall in interest rates due to an irrational
pessimism on their ability to make a profit.  This leads to
unemployment, which in turn leads to low consumption, which reinforces
the investor’s belief that they cannot make a profit.  Keynes suggested
that active government policy could be used to stimulate demand in times
of recession.  This became known as countercyclical fiscal policy; that
is running deficit spending when a country is in a recession, and
repaying the accumulated debt in boom times. *  
  
 *Since the Great Depression and FDR’s New Deal, this school of thought
has become a part of American fiscal policy.  The first few sections of
the reading will introduce the major aspects of this “macro” approach to
fiscal policy.  This approach is not without limits, however, and
countries cannot continually run deficits.  Thus, the issue of fiscal
sustainability will be the subject of the last sections of this unit.*
