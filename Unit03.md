**Unit 3: Subsidies** <span id="3"></span> 
*Subsidies are expenditures by the government intended to support an
activity that politicians or government bureaucrats think society needs
more of.  Subsidies are the opposite of taxes; rather than altering
individual behavior by making one activity less profitable than another,
they make one activity more profitable than another.  Much of the logic
that applies to taxes also applies to subsidies—only in reverse. 
Generally subsidies are justified on one of three arguments: (i)
redistribution of wealth, (ii) national interest, and (iii) to promote
positive externalities.  The first justification is a matter of national
values, which each country decides on the basis of their beliefs. 
Economists can help in this case by considering the economic costs and
benefits of this decision.  The second justification is one that is
liable to abuse by special interests, and one that does not warrant
extended discussion.  The third justification, however, is interesting
from an economic point of view, this justification will be considered in
the first section of this unit.  We will then move onto considering some
empirical evidence of the success that various kinds of subsidies have. 
As we move into Unit 4, it will be helpful to remember that both the
success and failure of policies can cause an increase in the demand for
government expenditure  Do you think that farmers who have been helped
by the government will want more or less support in the future?*
