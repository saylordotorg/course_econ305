**Unit 2: Taxes** <span id="2"></span> 
*In this unit, we will familiarize ourselves with the different kinds of
taxes that exist in policy today, including those that are less
frequently used.  This unit will distinguish the elements of a tax: (a)
the taxable base, which is the object or activity that the tax payment
is calculated on, (b) the person who remits the tax payment by actually
cutting a check to the government, and (c) the person(s) who bear the
economic burden of the tax.  You will learn that economists distinguish
between who pays a tax and whose behavior changes because of a tax.  In
ordinary conversations, these are often confused, but our toolset will
show that the tax burden doesn’t always fall on the person or company
that is explicitly being taxed.  We will also consider the cost of
deadweight losses, or welfare that is lost due to the changing behavior
of individuals given different policy choices.  Rational choice
individuals don’t like to pay taxes, so we will see the different ways
that they avoid paying taxes by changing what they invest in, and how
much they are willing to work based on the taxation of income.*
